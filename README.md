This is an attempt to make a port of
https://github.com/Optrak/akkaPersistenceNoAndroid

that works on Android.

Currently it fails with the errors shown in log copied in errorMsg2.txt.

Current environment:
+ Mac OS X 10.9.2
```
$ java -version
java version "1.8.0_05"
Java(TM) SE Runtime Environment (build 1.8.0_05-b13)
Java HotSpot(TM) 64-Bit Server VM (build 25.5-b02, mixed mode)
```
(The generated byte code works on Android, because it is targeting
an older version of the JVM) 
+ android-sdk-plugin from pfn's https://github.com/pfn/android-sdk-plugin version 1.2.14

+ Tim Pigden (https://github.com/TimPigden) from http://optrak.com/ who has been patient enough to work with me (and put up with my desire to be a better functional programmer).
+ Perry Nguyen (https://github.com/pfn, @pfn0 on twitter, *pfn* at irc channels #sbt-android, #android-dev), is **the man** for Android on Scala development!!) Thanks for helping me with my newbie's questions (and put up with me even when I didn't ask the most intelligent questions!). You're awesome!
